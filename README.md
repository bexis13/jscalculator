# Javascript Calculator

Part of the Free Code Camp Front End certification [A Javascript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) projects.

The user stories are:

   1.   I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
   2.   I can clear the input field with a clear button.
   3.    I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
   
    

You can find the application hosted on codepen [Here](https://codepen.io/bexis/full/KREMZx/).
